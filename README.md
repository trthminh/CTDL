# Sort Algorithms
In here, I will show you 3 sort-algorithms: HeapSort, MergeSort and QuickSort.
Beside, I also visualize time to run those algorithms and compare each other.
You can see full code in heapsort.cpp, mergesort.cpp, quicksort.cpp. And in main.cpp, I will call those algorithms. Because I think it will make code is clearlly and easy to see.

You can see the detailed running time of each algorithm through each data set in the file
